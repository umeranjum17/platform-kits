# Contributing to byokit

Thanks for helping. byokit is for people who just have a ChatGPT-like subscription: every word a person can see must be
plain (no commands, paths, model ids or error codes), and nothing may touch their other AI tools.

## Setup

Node 22.18 or later.

```sh
npm ci
npm run build   # tsc -b: each package's dist/
npm run check   # tsc over sources and tests, strict
npm test        # every test in a throwaway HOME, then a byte-for-byte check of your real ~/.pi
```

## Rules

- **Isolation first.** byokit never reads or writes a person's `~/.pi`, `~/.codex`, `~/.claude` or cloud credential files,
  never uses their environment's API keys, and never runs their CLIs. Tests use the harness in
  `packages/accounts/src/testing` (a decoy HOME, an fs tracer, canary tokens) and must never need a real account, the
  network or a model call. `npm test` fails if your own `~/.pi` changed during the run.
- **One package per concern**, small and dependency-light: `accounts`, `link`, `decide`, `ui-core`. Prefer deleting to adding.
- Sources are TypeScript that Node runs directly (type stripping): no enums, namespaces or parameter properties, and
  relative imports carry the `.ts` extension.
- Provider terms are data (`packages/accounts/src/catalogue.json`), with a one-line reason and a source. The kit labels
  and never decides for an app. Claude plan sign-in is never added.
- Plain words live in `words.json` and are tested against a banned-jargon list.
- Pi's `@earendil-works/pi-ai` is pinned exactly. Bump it deliberately, with the isolation tests green.
