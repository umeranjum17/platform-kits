# byokit

Bring your own AI plan and devices. Apache-2.0.

| Package | What it does | State |
|---|---|---|
| [`@byokit/accounts`](packages/accounts) | Sign in with the AI plan you already pay for, into your app's own store; limits, refresh, plain words | v0.1 |
| [`@byokit/ui-core`](packages/ui-core) | Headless sign-in state for any UI | v0.1 |
| `@byokit/link` | Scan a code to pair a phone or browser with the home computer over one encrypted link | placeholder |
| `@byokit/decide` | Typed questions in, a typed answer with confidence out, abstaining below a floor | placeholder |

byokit never touches a person's other AI tools: not their `~/.pi`, `~/.codex` or `~/.claude`, not their environment's
keys, not their CLIs. The tests prove it; see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
